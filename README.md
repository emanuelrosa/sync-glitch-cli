> Deploy a GitHub repository to glitch.com

It uses an API which is used in Glitch application and may be changed without any notice because it is not public. I use this script in [sotayamashita/pr-label](https://github.com/sotayamashita/pr-label/) and it is run by every week. It will help me know if it will be broken. Please keep this in the back of your head. I am looking forward to official API. :+1:

## Install

```
npm install glitch-deploy-cli --save-dev
```

## Usage

### How to get required environment variables

1. Open your project on Glitch
1. Open devtool and click the Network tab
1. Select Project name > Advanced Options > Import from GitHub
1. You can find a request URL which starts from `https://api.glitch.com/projects/githubImport ~`:

   ![network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1587053/33523225-a779160e-d844-11e7-9dc2-28e9afed9260.png)

1. It has three params. These params are what you need.

### How to set environment variables

You have to set the following environment variables:

- `GLITCH_PROJECT_ID` _(the Glitch project id.)_
- `GLITCH_TOKEN` _(the Glitch token)_
- `GH_REPO` _(the GitHub repo. e.g `sotayamashita/glitch-deploy-cli`)_

```
GLITCH_PROJECT_ID='' GLITCH_TOKEN='' GH_REPO='' ./node_modules/.bin/glitch-deploy
```

Enable debug logs:

```
GLITCH_PROJECT_ID='' GLITCH_TOKEN='' GH_REPO='' DEBUG=glitch-deploy* ./node_modules/.bin/glitch-deploy
```
